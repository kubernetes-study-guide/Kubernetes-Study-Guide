cover the big diagram from the trailer. 

Don't worry if you don't understand any of it. going to introduce lots of new terminologies here, to start seeding them in your head. 

So rewatch this video as you go through the course and you'll see stuff will start clicking and falling into place. 


By the end of this course, you'll learn:

- Setup your very own Kubernetes Environment using Minikube
- Run containers by creating pods
- Get pods talking to each other by creating services
- Create a group of identical pods using Replicasets and Deployments
- Create Ingress rules to make your pods accessible to the outside world
- Store your pod's data using Persistent Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims.
- ...AND Create all of these objects by first writng yaml files and then feeding these files to kubernetes


I'll also cover lots of other stuff along the way.
